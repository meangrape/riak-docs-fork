## Response

If the index is found, Riak will output a JSON object describing the
index, including its name, the [`n_val`]({{<baseurl>}}riak/kv/2.9.8/developing/app-guide/replication-properties/#a-primer-on-n-r-and-w) associated with it, and the [search schema]({{<baseurl>}}riak/kv/2.9.8/developing/usage/search-schemas) used by the index. Here is an example:

```json
{
  "name": "my_index",
  "n_val": 3,
  "schema": "_yz_default"
}
```
